Find a new cost/efficiency optimum in solar concentrators by
drastically reducing their material cost.

The idea is to use extremely cheap reflective materials  in order to make an
extremely low cost solar concentrator, thus enabling anyone to
accumulate heat energy from the sun for: cooking,
distillation/desalination or even generating electricity with a
stirling engine.

Possible approaches to reduce cost include:

* biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (mylar) foil
  stabilized by strings under tension inorder to make a convex shaped
  dish to focus the sun light.

* The use of (painted) acrylic sheets as mirrors rather than glass.

* The use of thin metal (aluminium) sheets/foil rather than mirrors.
