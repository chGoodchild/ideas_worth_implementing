A simple app that allows smartphone users who have regular earphones to use
their android as a bluetooth transciever, thus enabling them to use their 
earphones as "bluetooth earphones".

There might be some niche applications where smartphone users need bluetooth earphones 
(maybe quickly) and don't have the time and/or money to get dedicated hardware. They could
just connect the earphones to their phones, download the app and use their phone as a 
bluetooth transciever...
