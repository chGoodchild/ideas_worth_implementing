Principal Component Analysis is used to decompose an image into it's
key features (singular values), which occupy far less space than the
original image.

NFTs are basically the hash of an image stored on chain and they come
with the risk of the image getting lost, because the actual image
isn't stored on chain.

The idea: Store singular values on chain instead of the hash, or
allongside the hash of the image. This doesn't necessarily occupy much
more space, but it does add a lot of value in terms of availability.
