This idea isn't new, but it is worth mentioning:

Channel capacity is given by C = B log_2 (1 + S/N), where S/N is
the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and B is the available bandwidth.

One of the primary goals when improving communications hardware is to
increase the signal to noise ratio. This becomes increasingly
difficult and such efforts occur within the logarithm, thus resulting
in a very limited increase of cannel capacity. That's why it's critical to
make better use of bandwidth.

The available bandwidth can be used more effectively by:

1. Increasing the quality factor of the communications hardware.
2. Using orthogonal frequencies in order to mathematically
differentiate between communication channels that have overlapping
frequency bands (also known as OFDM).
3. Spacial separation of communication channels in order to avoid
interference and thus allow each channel to use multiple communication
bands.


Spacial separation is often achieved by using Multiple Inputs and
Multiple Outputs (MIMO) in order to create virtual apperatures that
direct signals like a directional antenna, thus reducing a signal's
effect on other nearby communication channels. This technology can
already be found in wifi routers (with multiple antennas), mobile
phone towers and even in the hardware of 5G devices.


When talking about (high density) mesh networks I would like to remind
everyone about how they further increase the spacial separation of
communication channels by allowing data to be sent accross multiple
small hops rather than a single long haul transmissions. Radio waves
follow the inverse square law, thus resulting in large (at best
quadratic) power savings when making many small hops rather than large hops. 
This reduction in transmission power also results in a reduced physical space
consumption of any given communication channel, thus allowing for more
parallel communication channels that use the same frequency bands and
a better use of the available bandwidth.

The idea:

With the advent of IoT and the widespread adoption of smartphones and
routers, we have a large unused potential of networking
infrastructure. It would make senese to incentivize the use of existing hardware
(smartphones and routers) as communication nodes, possibly using a
blockchain (or distributed ledger/tangle). Rather than having network failures 
due to a lack of available bandwidth, places with a high client(/node) density 
would have an extremely high throughput thanks to their high node density which allows 
for a lot of parallel channels that have a short hop distance/low transmission power.

Existing (TCP/IP) infrastructure could be updated to incorporate a reward for 
nodes/"miners" that contribute towards delivering packets on the network. A deflationary
reward combined with tips could result in a race condition where nodes compete to
provide the best networking service on various metrics. 


Summary:
The advantages of a decentralized approach are that it has the
potential to save energy and drastically increase throughput with
existing hardware, while ensuring that the networking infrastructure
is always where the demand is (because the consumer is also the
supplier).
